Moreover, I run every third day, and do other mild physical exercises between these days. The app did not convince me to change this rhythm, and as such I only performed the daily activity on days where the suggested activity coincided with my planned activities (e.g. run/walk on days where I run anyway). What's more is that the surveys were annoying to fill in due to the bad date format (American, we're Dutch), and need to constantly fill in things like e-mail address. Why not integrate this into the app with a simple 1-5 star rating?"
